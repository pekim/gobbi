<p>gobbi is a set of generated Go bindings for gobject based libraries.
There are bindings, with varying degrees of completeness,
for gtk, gdk, gdkpixbuf, gio, gobject, and glib.</p>

<p>The intention is to provide the bindings required
for writing gtk applications.
So the focus is on supporting functions in the higher level
libraries such as gtk, gdk, gdkpixbuf and gio.
Much of the functionality provided by the lower level
libraries, such as glib and gobject, is adequately supported
in Go core packages.</p>
