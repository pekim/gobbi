Minimal API docs are generated,
and are available at
https://godoc.org/github.com/pekim/gobbi.

## library functions
For most library API functions
the generated documentation says little more than
what function is being wrapped.
The
[Gnome API Reference](https://developer.gnome.org/references)
documentation should be referenced for details of the APIs. 

## gobbi-specific functions
The documentation for gobbi-specific functions
should be of some use.
